# üåû Sun-Path + Cave Geometry Simulator

## üìñ Quranic Context

This project is inspired by **Surah Al-Kahf (18:17-18)**, which describes a remarkable phenomenon regarding the **People of the Cave**:

> ‚ÄúAnd you would have seen the sun, when it rose, inclining away from their cave to the right, and when it set, declining away from them to the left, while they lay in its open space‚Ä¶ That is one of the signs of Allah.‚Äù  
> _(Qur‚Äôan 18:17)_

The verses imply a **specific cave orientation and solar path** that preserved the sleepers over centuries. By simulating sun trajectories at chosen latitudes and cave orientations, we aim to **explore the geometry** hinted at in the Qur‚Äôanic narrative and analyze the physical plausibility of the described sunlight behavior.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Simulate** the daily solar azimuth and elevation for any latitude, longitude, and date.
- **Visualize** how the sun‚Äôs path would interact with a cave mouth of given orientation and tilt.
- **Identify configurations** where the sunlight ‚Äúinclines away‚Äù during sunrise and sunset, consistent with 18:17.
- Provide a **tool for students, researchers, and enthusiasts** to explore potential historical or geographical scenarios matching the Qur‚Äôanic description.
- **Encourage deeper reflection** on the precision and meaning of the verses while respecting religious significance.

## üß≠ Outcomes

- A **Next.js web application** with interactive controls:
  - Adjustable latitude, longitude, date, and cave geometry.
  - Dynamic 2D/3D plots of the sun‚Äôs path.
  - Highlighted time intervals where sunlight avoids direct penetration.
- Data tables of solar positions for further analysis.
- Potential for **new insights** into cave orientations or locations that fit the Qur‚Äôanic description.
